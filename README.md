# PostgreSQL-Project
A SQL project where the user can run various queries on a database. Created for a course at SFU.

Please read the PDF for information about this project, and the SQL queries I created.
Also note that the program connects to a database that may not exist anymore. You can edit the connection details in the program if you wish to run it. All that's needed is an empty PostgreSQL database.
